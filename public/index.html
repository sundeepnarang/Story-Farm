        <h1>Story Farm</h1><h2>An innovative approach to cultivate art and story telling for children and adults</h2>
        <p class="lead">Our aim was to encourage you to both look at art, and to make your own, in an accessible, fun and whimsical way. The idea is to explore paintings and to deconstruct them into isolated components that that could then be altered and reconstituted into new compositions.<br/><br/>To begin this process, we've 'taken apart' a series of paintings by Alexander Gorlizki and created a library of icons, textures and backgrounds.</p>
